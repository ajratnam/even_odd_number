"""
The purpose of this module is to show, how to find whether a number is
either an odd or even integer, by comparing the number with its lcm with 2.

The lcm of 2 and an even number is the even number itself, because 2 is a factor in the even number
whereas in the case of odd numbers, since 2 is a prime number and its not a factor of the odd number,
the lcm is 2 * odd_number, but we need not worry about this value, as we can simply put it together as


"The number is even if its lcm with 2 is the number itself, otherwise it is odd."

Examples
--------
This is an example on showing the usage of the is_even function

>>> is_even(42)
True

>>> is_even(23)
False

>>> is_even(-2)
True

>>> is_even(-9)
False

>>> is_even([1, 2, 3])
TypeError: Expected parameter (number) to be an integer, but got as list ([1, 2, 3])

Notes
-----
The is_even function can be verified by calling this script via the test.py program.

python test.py lcm.py

    This is a function, which is used to check whether
    a giver number is either odd or even.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number : int
        The number which you want to check whether its even or odd.

    Returns
    -------
    is_even : bool
        Whether the number is even or not.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the given value for number, is not an integer.

    if not isinstance(number, int):  # Check if the given value is an integer
        # If not so, then raise TypeError
        raise TypeError(f'Expected parameter (number) to be an integer, but got as {type(number).__name__} ({number})')

    # Now we verified that the given value is an integer.
    # Now, we check whether the lcm of 2 and the given number
    # is same as the absolute value of number and return the result.

    # Why absolute value?
    # (Example)
    #     The lcm of 2 and -4 is 4
    #     but the given number is -4
    #     we clearly know that 4 is not same as -4
    #     that's why we have to convert -4 to 4
    #     and if you didn't catch it by now,
    #     abs(-4) does exactly that.

# What is this if statement over here?
#     Well, we want to make our lcm function reusable
#     so that we can just import the is_even function
#     and use it anywhere, but also we want our
#     program to run if we run this file directly.
#
#     If we didnt add this statement, then
#     our below program will run everytime we import it.
#
#     So to avoid that python has __name__.
#     __name__ will be "__main__" if this program is run directly
#     otherwise it will not.

        else:

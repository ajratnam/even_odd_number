//In this program, we check whether a number is even or odd by looping from 1 to n. In each loop a variable (initially 0) is increased by 1 and if in last loop it was increased in the next loop it is decreased by 1. So, after nth loop if -1 and +1 is repeated for even times it is zero else it is non-zero. Thus, zero means even and non-zero means odd.
